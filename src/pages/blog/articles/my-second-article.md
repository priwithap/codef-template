To What Extent is There a Meaning to Life, 
and How Should we Live? 

Introduction

In The Myth of Sisyphus, Albert Camus proposes that not only is there no meaning to life the 
human intellect could ever discover, but also that we should nonetheless continue to live: 
‘one must imagine Sisyphus happy’ (1942, p. 111). In this essay, I aim to discuss Camus’ 
concepts of the Absurd, the feeling of absurdity, and his solution to how we should live, in 
order to provide an overview into the absurdist view of whether there is a meaning to life. I 
will evaluate Camus’ absurdism with regards to existentialist beliefs about the meaning of 
life, specifically from Simone de Beauvoir’s The Prime of Life, by considering Iris 
Murdoch’s critique of Jean-Paul Sartre’s existentialism and applying it instead to Camus 
views. I will then consider whether the ‘Absurd Hero’ in The Myth of Sisyphus can 
sufficiently answer to these critiques, via the perspective of the Absurd heroes in Samuel 
Beckett’s Waiting for Godot. Through doing so, I wish to argue for the view that the pursuit 
of an empty, inauthentic ‘meaning’ in life as a means to an end is, like Camus argues, an 
absurd activity. Nonetheless, the process of authentically attempting to create and live a 
meaningful life, despite knowing and perhaps, like Camus proposes, embracing the absurdity 
of this, can provide value to individuals and even a community at large. 
Absurdity and the Absurd 
Camus, In The Myth of Sisyphus, explicitly distinguishes two important ideas core to 
absurdism: the feeling of the absurd, and the (‘notion’ of the) Absurd itself (p. 32). Firstly, 
the feeling of the absurd can begin from the ‘deepest desire’ of our minds to understand the 
world with ‘clarity’ and to ‘reduce it to the human’ (pp. 22-23). When we come to face the 
‘uselessness’ of our suffering, when we realise there is no ‘profound reason for living’, the 
world around us suddenly feels foreign, and we realise how the world can’t be explained (p. 
13). This dissociation of the ‘actor’ and their ‘setting’, this ‘divorce’ between a person and 
their life, is the feeling of the absurdity as told by Camus (p. 13). This sounds quite dramatic, 
and one might question whether this is just a temporary oddity amid our lives, a brief 
overwhelm that we overcome after taking a walk or petting a dog. Surely, in the grand 
scheme of things, we all have goals to achieve, dreams to make reality, and this feeling of 
‘absurdity’ is just one obstacle of many in the way? Modern day psychology and health may 
suggest that this is all a natural mental experience and can be remedied by speaking to 
someone, drinking water, and breathing deeply (OxfordCBT, 2022). But to Camus, it is not a 
glitch: the very fact that some commit suicide because of the realisation of there being no real 
reason to live makes the question of whether life is worth living a ‘fundamental question of 
philosophy’ (p. 11). He supports this argument by bringing to light the fact that even Galileo 
did not, in the end, die for a certain discovery, although many do die because they judge life 
isn’t worth living (p. 11). I think he argues his point well- someone who feels overwhelmed 
and is contemplating the meaning behind their existence can’t possibly find any comfort in 
‘breathing deeply’- this seems to be a mere coping mechanism rather than a solution, and 
only mkes one more deeply aware of how lonely existence is- we must defeat each obstacle 
ourselves, no one else can do the things that scare or overwhelm you on your behalf.

So, whilst absurdity is trying to find meaning in a meaningless world, the Absurd arises from 
this ‘confrontation’ between our need for a meaning, and the ‘unreasonable silence of the 
world’ (p. 31-32). It doesn’t exist in the world, nor in the self, but is what ‘links’ them 
together (p. 26). One way in which we come across the Absurd is through noticing our 
‘mechanical life’, where we do the same repeated actions day in and day out, without 
question (p. 19). Some may say that we do these things with a purpose- we go to work to feed 
ourselves and buy the items and objects that bring us happiness. On the other hand, this could 
just be a part of the ‘stage-set’ that collapses (p.19) once we realise that we were born into 
this world without reason or question, and we get on with life with the same absence of 
inquiry into why we unquestionably live. We may question why it is that certain items bring 
us joy, and whether we were influenced into feeling that way, reducing that ‘happiness’ that 
we thought we derived from certain objects down to nothing but a façade. Camus asserts that 
there are two choices after being conscious of the ‘weariness’ of mechanical life: either you 
return to it, or you embark on a ‘definitive awakening’ (p. 19). This awakening leads to either 
‘suicide or recovery’ (p.19), and Camus argues we should choose the latter. He says that the 
virtuous act would be to ‘stay there’ (p. 17), facing the uncomfortable Absurd, revolting 
against it rather than agreeing with it, as Sisyphus (a mortal condemned by Greek gods in a 
mythology to rolling a rock up a mountain for eternity (p. 107)) chooses to do. 
This leads to Camus’ solution to the Absurd and the feeling of absurdity. We can’t escape or 
defeat the Absurd- it is a permanent ‘gap’ between our seeking of a meaning and the 
unanswering universe that ‘will never be filled’ (p. 24). Essentially, there is no meaning, and 
the pursuit of meaning is absurd because it is not within our capacity to discover. So how 
should we live? Camus argues that we should become, like Sisyphus, our own ‘absurd hero’ 
(p. 108). This doesn’t mean we should pack our bags, move to a foreign country, and reinvent 
ourselves. We can continue with our ‘mechanical life’, but with the awareness and 
acceptance of the Absurd. For example, even Sisyphus has a mechanical life of his own, 
rolling the boulder up a mountain only to have to watch it roll back down, descend himself, 
and roll it back up again, forever. What makes him an ‘absurd hero’ is his attitude towards 
this fate: his fate ‘belongs to him’, and the rock is ‘his thing’ (p. 110). Sure, without meaning, 
our lives may be a ‘futile and hopeless labour’ (p. 107), but it is nonetheless ours, and like 
how Sisyphus is ‘superior to his fate’ and ‘stronger than his rock’ (p. 109) when he 
consciously returns to the bottom of the mountain, we too are above our predicaments when 
we choose to continue to live through them. Furthermore, Camus claims that if we can 
choose to do this ‘in sorrow’, then it can also happen joyfully (p. 109). This, however, may be 
questionable- just because A, does that necessarily mean not A too? A or not A is a 
tautology, so we may be inclined to say yes logically. 
Overall, Camus says that there is no meaning to life that we could know, and so rather than 
trying to pursue something that cannot be gained, we should instead enjoy the pursuit itself, 
knowing full well that although it will not lead to an end (the end being finding a meaning to 
life), there is much to be gained from the process itself. Take for example, someone who 
decides from an early age to become a doctor, due to a desire to help others. After a few years 
of achieving this aspiration, they realise that their heart has moved on. Were the previous 
years of their life studying medicine a futile waste of time? Should they despair over what the 
meaning of life is, if human nature is so fickle that it can lead to such a waste of effort? I 
think it would be absurd to say yes, because surely, they have learnt and gained a lot from 
3 
this experience, such as working under pressure and experiencing the fruits of hard work. 
They may discover a love for art, and this time, know that it may not last, but enjoy the 
experience gained nonetheless, escaping that predicament they previously faced by 
embracing and accepting it. Chasing meaning for the sake of simply obtaining it is a 
hopeless, absurd act, but knowing and enjoying this endless chase- that is how we should 
live. 
Critiques 
Iris Murdoch criticised Sartre’s existentialism on the grounds of it being too ‘solipsistic’ 
(1953, p. 106). Does this apply in the case of Camus’ absurdism? The absurd hero in the story 
appears to be a hero only for themselves, focusing on their own rock and seemingly nothing 
else. In a world full of tragedies and suffering, applying absurdism could seem too 
individualistic. On the other hand, the question of suicide is a deeply personal one, and life 
too, is lived through our and only our perspective, suggesting that Camus is not wrong to 
focus on the individual only. Plus, the critique assumes a virtuous life to be one that includes 
helping others, and one may question why that must necessarily be the case- as long as you 
do not harm anyone else, why should anyone be obliged to help others? Is it really immoral to 
focus on the self, even when it concerns why one should live and not commit suicide? And to 
take it further, can’t one help others by preventing one suicide (that of their own)? Although I 
believe Camus’ absurdism first and foremost must start with the self, I believe that once one 
has helped themselves, although they are not obliged to help others, it should be encouraged. 
Simone de Beauvoir in The Prime of Life claims that liberty is ‘the very modal essence of 
existence’ (1960, p. 549). She implies that some people (for example, women) live their 
existence appearing via immanence rather than transcendence and tackling this problem will 
allow us to ‘set freedom free’ (p. 549). To her, immanence is about sustaining our lives and 
the lives of others (for example, the role of a housewife), whereas transcendency is a life 
purely and authentically for oneself (perhaps like an author like Beauvoir herself). Human 
existence, therefore, becomes a good act when it is exercised for conquering privilege. 
Although this could be an example for how one can use their philosophy to improve the lives 
of others, it can be questioned how absurdism could take this into account- is absurdism 
incompatible with helping others? 
Personally, I don’t think absurdism has to be individualistic. For example, in Samuel 
Beckett’s 1953 play Waiting for Godot, the two main characters wait for someone called 
Godot, who they don’t know anything about. They can be seen as absurd heroes, and their 
humorous attitude gets them through their otherwise meaningless days and nights together, 
hence suggesting that absurdism can not only spark joy within oneself but also amongst 
others. 
Conclusion 
To conclude, I agree with Camus that there is no intrinsic meaning in life, that chasing it will 
not benefit us, and that we should instead live in a way that embraces this aspect of life, 
whilst also trying to help others. Therefore, even though there may not be a tangible meaning 
to life, the process of seeking one out despite knowing this in the name of self-development 
and betterment can be not only a positive but also a selfless act- and this is how we should 
live.
